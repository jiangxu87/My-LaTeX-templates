# Introduction

## Introduction

- The simultaneous transmission of both quantum and classical information over a quantum channel was initially investigated in [-@DeSh05] from an information theoretic point of view, and followed up by many others (see, e. g. [-@yard2005simultaneous, -@hsieh2010entanglement, -@hsieh2010trading]). 

# Background

## Background and Notations

Our discussion is based on the theory of stabilizer quantum codes and its connection to classical error-correcting codes (see, e. g., @CRSS98). We use the following notations. 

# Results

## Results (Code Search)

We perform a search for $\mathcal{C}=[\![n,k{:}m,d]\!]_2$ codes with distance $d\ge 3$.

# Discussion

## Discussion

- We have characterized hybrid quantum codes for the simultaneous transmission of quantum and classical information in terms of generalized Knill-Laflamme conditions. 

# Conclusions

## Conclusions

- We consider the characterization as well as the construction of quantum codes that allow to transmit both quantum and classical information, which we refer to as "**hybrid codes**".
